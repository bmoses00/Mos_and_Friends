Our project is a site where the user can view graphs of US economic data
such as GDP growth, treasury yields, or unemployment data over time.
Additionally, the site will feature several interactive 'case studies' in
important economic events in US history, such as showing the impact of the
spike in oil prices on inflation and unemployment during the 1973 recession.

Finally, we will allow users to create their own case studies by combining
graphs of their choice with their own analysis. They will then be able to
publish their case studies on the site for others to use.
